  "details": "This module allows uploading a zip file and extracting its content in the public file directory to serve this content from a Drupal website.\n\nThese zip files may contain arbitrary HTML or SVG content that could allow cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. While this is an expected feature, the module does not sufficiently restrict this functionality to trusted users with a \"restricted access\" permission. Users without a restricted permission should not be able to inject arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission *create [bundle] content* permission.",
